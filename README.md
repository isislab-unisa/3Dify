The 3Dify project aims to permit avatar creation using advanced AI and a modular software architecture. Such modular architecture allowed a flexible and scalable development, ensuring easy updates and improvement.

## Application front end

The front end provides users with a gallery of pictures they have uploaded to generate their avatars. The gallery is proposed as a grid of photos to make it look familiar to users accustomed to picture galleries installed on their smartphones. Alongside the gallery, users are provided with a box to upload their pictures through drag-and-drop and selection from their computer.

Consider that a user uploads a picture either way; the platform shows users the update's progress to keep them informed about what is happening to avoid refreshes or other actions that could only worsen the user experience, even though loading a picture does not take much time. When the loading is complete, users can access the picture from the gallery, and by clicking on it, they can preview the picture and gain access to several features. Below the preview, they have an action bar with options such as zoom-in, zoom-out, flip horizontally and vertically, rotate in both directions and the most important oneâ€“the customization option, which is dedicated to avatar customization and rendering using the Unity-based front end.

The application does not support logging in yet, but it is already designed with the capabilities to do so, and this is why users can already see buttons for logging in and out. This functionality will be enabled in future versions.

### Architecture

The application front end architecture comprises a web application, a file store, and a NoSQL database.

1. The `web application` is built with the **Next.js** framework, which allows us to develop both the front-end and back-end using **TypeScript**.
   The front-end is designed as a Single-Page Application (SPA) and written in **React**, also taking advantage of the abstractions offered by Next.js.
   Another benefit of Next.js is the possibility to use **Next.js API Routes** to create a serverless back-end to optimize resource utilization.
2. **MinIO** is used as `file store` for persisting uploaded photos, generated avatars, etc.
3. For the `database`, the application leverages **MongoDB** capabilities for storing users' information and more.

## Avatar customization and rendering WebGL web front-end

## User Evaluation Survey

We conducted a user survey to evaluate the performance of our tool, 3Dify, which is available online at this link. The survey assessed two primary aspects of the avatars generated by the application: the rendering quality and their resemblance to the original selfie images.

Participants were asked to evaluate 14 3D avatars by comparing a video showing the avatar's idling animation with the original selfie image. We provided the original image, the name of the public person, and a description of the customization adopted to generate the avatar.


## Getting Started

The easiest way to start the application is to run the development server:

```bash
# install missing required dependencies
npm install

# run the development server
npm run dev
```

Alternatively, run using Docker:

```bash
# build the image
docker build -t 3dify .

# run the container
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name 3dify 3dify
```

Watch with Docker Compose is also supported:

```bash
# launch application
docker compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml up -d

# watch application
docker compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml watch

# stop the application
docker compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml down
```
